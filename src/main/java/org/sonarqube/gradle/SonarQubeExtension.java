/**
 * An extension for configuring the <a href="http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Analyzing+with+Gradle">SonarQube</a> analysis.
 * <p>
 * The extension is added to all projects that have the {@code "sonar-gradle"} plugin applied, and all of their subprojects.
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * sonarqube {
 *   skipProject = false // this is the default
 *   properties {
 *     property "sonar.host.url", "http://my.sonar.server" // adding a single property
 *     properties mapOfProperties // adding multiple properties at once
 *     properties["sonar.sources"] += sourceSets.other.java.srcDirs // manipulating an existing property }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <h3>SonarQube Properties</h3>
 * <p>
 * The SonarQube configuration is provided by using the {@link #properties(org.gradle.api.Action)} method and specifying properties.
 * Certain properties are required, such as {@code "sonar.host.url"} which provides the address of the SonarQube server.
 * For details on what properties are available, see <a href="http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Analysis+Parameters">Analysis Parameters</a>
 * in the SonarQube documentation.
 * <p>
 * The {@code "sonar-gradle"} plugin adds default values for several plugins depending on the nature of the project.
 * Please see the <a href="http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Analyzing+with+Gradle">SonarQube Gradle documentation</a>
 * for details on which properties are set and their values.
 * <p>
 * Please see the {@link SonarQubeProperties} class for more information on the mechanics of setting SonarQube properties,
 * including laziness and property types.

   * Every system property starting with {@code "sonar."} is automatically set on the "root" project of the SonarQube run 
   * (i.e. the project that has the {@code sonar-gradle} plugin applied).
   * System properties take precedence over properties declared in build scripts.
